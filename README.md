# üß¥ AutoSanitize: Automatic Alcohol Spray Dispenser

**AutoSanitize** is a smart, touch-free hand sanitizing system that automatically sprays alcohol-based disinfectant when it detects a human hand or body nearby. Designed to reduce physical contact and promote hygiene, it's perfect for public entrances, offices, schools, and hospitals.

## üß∞ Components Used

| Component             | Quantity |
|-----------------------|----------|
| Arduino Nano / Uno    | 1        |
| Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) or IR Sensor | 1        |
| Small Pump or Spray Motor | 1        |
| Relay Module or Transistor Driver | 1        |
| Tubing + Nozzle       | 1 set    |
| Power Supply (5V or 12V depending on pump) | 1        |
| Jumper Wires          | As needed |
| Sound Speaker         | 1 each   |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. A sensor detects the presence of a hand or person.
2. The Arduino triggers the **relay** to activate the **spray pump**.
3. A short spray of alcohol or sanitizer is released.
4. The system waits briefly before becoming active again.
5. The system has a sound alert.
